<h1>SQL Filters</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

#### Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the security of an organization's systems. My role involves ensuring system safety, investigating potential security issues, and updating employee computers as necessary. The following steps illustrate how I utilized SQL with filters to perform various security-related tasks.

#### Tasks Completed

1. **Retrieve After-Hours Failed Login Attempts**:
   - Investigated potential security incidents by retrieving all failed login attempts that occurred after business hours (after 18:00).

2. **Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates**:
   - Analyzed login activity on 2022-05-09, as a suspicious event took place on this date. Any login attempts from this day or the preceding day were retrieved for investigation.

3. **Retrieve Login Attempts Outside of Mexico**:
   - Identified and investigated login attempts that originated from locations outside of Mexico, based on concerns about unauthorized access.

4. **Retrieve Employees in Marketing**:
   - Collected information on employees in the Marketing department to facilitate updates to their computers as part of a security initiative.

5. **Retrieve Employees in Finance or Sales**:
   - Gathered data on employees in the Finance and Sales departments to prepare for a different security update required for these teams.

6. **Retrieve All Employees Not in IT**:
   - Compiled a list of employees not in the Information Technology department to conduct a final security update for this group.

#### Outcome
This project effectively utilized SQL to filter and retrieve critical security information, enabling the organization to address vulnerabilities and implement necessary updates across various departments.
